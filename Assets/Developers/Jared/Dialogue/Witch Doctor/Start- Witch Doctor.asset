  - Hey there, would you be willing to do me a favor?
  - I need some souls for a project I am working on. Could you go over to Dead Man's
    Sands and get me some souls?
  - All you need to do is kill the ghost ships over there and return their souls
    to me. I will give you a lanturn that lets you speak to the dead.
