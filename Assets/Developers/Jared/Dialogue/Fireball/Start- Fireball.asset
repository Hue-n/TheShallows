  - OoOoOOooOOoO, I AM A GHOST
  - Haha I hope that I didn't scare you too bad, thank you for killing those other
    ghosts, those guys were jerks.
  - You look like someone who likes explosions. Now that I am a ghost I can't enjoy
    them the same way you can.
  - I have a secret stash of fireball rounds that I keep in Barrel Beach.
  - If you can find them, you can have them.
