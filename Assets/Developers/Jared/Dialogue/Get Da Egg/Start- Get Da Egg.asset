  - Well look at that. Silver Tooth's old rickety ship with a young new crew. I hope
    that old geezer is doing alright.
  - You guys look like you are seeking an adventure, why don't you go fetch something
    for me.
  - 'I really wanna rub an egg on my head. But not just any egg, a kraken egg. Go
    to the kraken''s nest and snatch her egg. '
  - She probably won't be there, krakens leave their eggs alone for the most part
    until they are ready to hatch.
